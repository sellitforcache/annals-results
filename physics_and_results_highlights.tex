\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item WARP, a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo neutron transport code, has been developed and benchmarked against production codes MCNP and Serpent.
\item WARP produces statistically identical results for a number of test cases but also differs significantly for some.
\item The performance of running WARP on high-end GPU cards is similar to 1-7 supercomputer nodes, depending on the node hardware and problem type.
\item Algorithms and data structures have been adjusted to improve efficiency and accuracy compared to previous publications about WARP.
\end{itemize}
