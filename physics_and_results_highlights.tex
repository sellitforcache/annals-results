%Highlights are mandatory for this journal. They consist of a short collection of bullet points that convey the core findings of the article and should be submitted in a separate file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point). See http://www.elsevier.com/highlights for examples.

\title{Highlights from:\\ ``Algorithmic Choices in WARP - A Framework for Continuous Energy Monte Carlo Neutron Transport in General 3D Geometries on GPUs''}
\author{Ryan M. Bergmann, Jasmina L. Vuji\'c}
\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item WARP, a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo neutron transport code, has been developed.
\item The NVIDIA OptiX high-performance ray tracing library is used to process geometric data.
\item The unionized cross section representation is modified for higher performance.
\item Reference remapping is used to keep the GPU busy as neutron batch population reduces.
\item Reference remapping is done using a key-value radix sort on neutron reaction type.
\end{itemize}
