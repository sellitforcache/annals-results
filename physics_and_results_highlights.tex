\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item WARP has been developed and benchmarked against production codes MCNP and Serpent.
\item WARP produces statistically identical results for a number of test cases.
\item WARP results also differ significantly for the most geometrically complex cases.
\item WARP performs like 1-7 supercomputer nodes, depending on hardware and problem type.
\item Hardware and running cost savings could also be realized with WARP.
\item Improvements have been made compared to previous publications about WARP.
\end{itemize}
